                    <p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> very rightly says, a programming language should be
malleable. It should allow you to quickly prototype a project and then
beat the code into shape. </p>
<p>Static typing, like in java, is prohibitive of this approach. Another 
feature I feel is unnecessarily bureaucratic : interfaces. Interfaces 
sound too good to be true. They smell a lot like modularity and it is
remarkable how if used correctly, they can lead to highly decoupled 
code. But interfaces also hide a lot of data. The actual implementation 
may contain substantial information that is inaccessible to outside 
code. </p>
<p>The more I program in Java, the more I feel it spends more time preventing 
me from doing things, than helping me out. In a way, you turn out to be 
your own "pointy-haired-boss". First, the PHB in you writes the interface. 
Then the employee in you starts writing an implementation based on the 
guidelines laid down by the PHB. Once this is done, you both are happy 
until there arises a requirement for some more features that this interface
doesn't support. You send a request to PHB, he writes more of the interface 
and the employee in you writes more code to implement the interface and this 
cycle continues.</p>
<p>I am writing a RIA in <a href="http://webtoolkit.googlecode.com/">GWT</a>. I am trying to adhere to the design patterns 
laid out in the documentation. Sometimes, in the spirit of the code, just
to make something work, I tend to step out of the design pattern and code
arbitrarily. Now, when I have to refactor the code to align it to the pattern,
I find myself terrified of the effort it would take to acheive that.</p>
<p>Having been on Java for about 3 months, when I try to write python
code, I find myself thinking in Java. I find the lack of types and interfaces
difficult to manage. I am writing up un-pythonic reflection based systems to
implement features similar to interfaces and type-checking in java. </p>
<p>Python, I shall see you soon, and when I do...</p>

                <span class="post-date">May, 2011</span>
                <div id="post-contents" class="post-contents">
                    <p>Disclosure: The source code and some other ideas are from one of 
<a href="http://kennethjorgensen.com/blog/2010/04/12/proxy-servlet-for-gwt-in-devmode/">Kenneth Jorgensen's blog post</a></p>
<p>As you start developing with the Google Web Toolkit, you may find yourself
stuck because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">"Same Origin Policy"</a> restrictions that browser
developers have implemented. </p>
<p>The SOP restricts scripts running on the browser from placing
XmlHTTPRequests to hosts other than the host from which the current page 
was requested. This is a short, possibly imprecise definition. What really
matters is that if you develop your server-side API in a language other than
Java, you will have trouble accessing that API while in devmode.</p>
<p>What you can do is, use a language-agnostic servlet that runs on the GWT 
development mode server and proxies your requests to another server.<br />
</p>
<p>I won't dump the entire java servlet file here. You can find a link
<a href="/media/resources/ProxyServlet.java">here</a>. There is a dirty hack in the servlet; I describe it later. </p>
<p>To make this work, you have to edit the web.xml file within the
WEB-INF directory within the war directory not the *.gwt.xml file.
As far as I understand, (I am a noob to GWT) the *.gwt.xml file is
to be updated with the details of a servlet when you use GWT-RPC.</p>
<p>Here is a snapshot of my web.xml.</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE web-app</span>
<span class="cp">    PUBLIC &quot;-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN&quot;</span>
<span class="cp">    &quot;http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd&quot;&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;web-app&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;servlet&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;servlet-name&gt;</span>proxy<span class="nt">&lt;/servlet-name&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;servlet-class&gt;</span>in.dmulog.gwt.ProxyServlet<span class="nt">&lt;/servlet-class&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/servlet&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;servlet-name&gt;</span>proxy<span class="nt">&lt;/servlet-name&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;url-pattern&gt;</span>/proxy/*<span class="nt">&lt;/url-pattern&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;</span>
    <span class="c">&lt;!-- Default page to serve --&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;welcome-file-list&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;welcome-file&gt;</span>Client.html<span class="nt">&lt;/welcome-file&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/welcome-file-list&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/web-app&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now, if you update the code according to your own setup, any
requests at <span class="inline_code">localhost:8888/proxy/this/uri</span> will be forwarded to
<span class="inline_code">localhost:8000/this/uri</span>. Or as the case may be. You can define all
this in the java servlet file. </p>
<p>Now about the dirty hack I talked about. Within the java file, line
number 68 reads:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">uri</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">append</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">req</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getRequestURI</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">substring</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="o">));</span>
</pre></div>
<p>What the substring part does is converts
<span class="inline_code">localhost:8888/proxy/foo/bar/baz</span> to a request to
<span class="inline_code">localhost:8000/foo/bar/baz</span>. </p>
<p>If we don't use the substring hack, it remains as a request to
<span class="inline_code">localhost:8000/<strong>proxy</strong>/foo/bar/baz</span> which might not be useful in
your case. You can possibly do this better with splitting the string
and joining. But hey, I said it was dirty. </p>
<p>Happy coding.</p>

                <span class="post-date">October, 2010</span>
                <div id="post-contents" class="post-contents">
                    <p>I had to select a few developers to work with me at developing the <a href="http://www.ecell-iitkgp.org">ecell website</a> further. 
There are many loose ends to tie up. However, working out a selection procedure was in itself
a mammoth task. I had to try to keep the technicalities to a minimum, focus on logic and interest, 
both of which are difficult to cardinalize. I came up with a solution, with help from Sid who selected
me in my first year. Test them on fundamentals which are not bound to any language/framework in particular.
Logical tests and some database concepts. The common element in all these would-be questions was that they
had left me amazed when I discovered the answers. </p>
<p>Here is the paper.</p>
<iframe width=100% height=560px frameborder=0 src=https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=false&api=true&embedded=true&srcid=0BxG0waWYlVh4YjlhZGMxZDktYTQ1Mi00MDZlLTk5MGQtNDg3OWY4ZWI4YjM1&hl=en></iframe>

<h2>Discussion:</h2>
<p>Question 1:</p>
<p>Concentrating on the relationship between the books and authors is the key point in this question.
In one particular solution, there are 3 tables. One representing the authors. another for the books
and a third one for the relationship. This table is often called a linker table.</p>
<img src="/media/im/web-selections-db.png">

<p>As is clearly visible, the linker table takes the pk (primary key:a unique identifier) of a book and 
a pk of the author and connects the two in a manner which limits the number of columns : A key requirement
in a database schema.</p>
<p>Question 2:</p>
<p>The flaw in this code snippet is that the /astra url will never be reached. This is because the line
immediately above it captures all urls which begin with /a (including /astra) and the control never reaches 
the /astra line. One way to circumvent this is to swap the two lines. This way, the condition is avoided.</p>
<p>Question 3:</p>
<p>We could use javascript to preload the images. This is the easy way out and works most of the time. I agree this
involves prior knowledge of this feature. But infact, there is another way : Sprites.
Assume you have the case as mentioned in the question. A rollover button. You have one image. When you move the mouse
over the image, it changes. Assume the images are both 40x20 in size. Now you can compose an image of 40x40 size 
containing both the images in two halves. Then using the CSS property of background-position, you can easily shift the image
at the required event. This is a sure-shot method since there is only one image and will have been downloaded completely
if it is being displayed at all. I agree, this question does require
prior knowledge as well. But people who are interested should have
some advantages; right?</p>
<p>Question 4:</p>
<p>This question was indeed a tough one. <a href="http://www.yeban.in">Anurag</a> came up with it. The question has many answers. Maybe I will ask him 
to come up with his own some day. For now, you are stuck with my version of it. So here goes.</p>
<p>One way is to fetch different kinds of data from different fine-tuned servers (think Content Delivery Networks). For
example, images could be fetched from a server running Nginx which is one of the fastest static content servers
I have seen. Also, some form of load-balancing server could be used to distribute the load across multiple servers.
This answers both the cases of scalability and optimisation.</p>
<p>Another method could be to use redundant data-servers across diverse geographical locations.</p>
