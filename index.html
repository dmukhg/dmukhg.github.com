                    <p>I am a vim user.  <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2156">Leo</a> was my choice of a colorscheme.  It offers
quite a palette of well-balanced colours.  Contrast is adequately 
high while on a laptop.</p>

<p>When I switched to a desktop, I spent substantial time trying to
figure out the perfect brightness/contrast ratio.  One that soothed
the eyes. </p>
<p>I don't recall how I came across you, <a href="http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/">zenburn</a>, but my eyes are
thankful that I did.  You make my background a lighter shade of
grey and use a subtle palette of pastel colours.  The lowered contrast
enables me to take code in for longer hours.  What would I do without
you!</p>

<p>What is most surprising about you, my dear, is that you make my 
comments look great.  The more comments I have, the prettier you
make my code look.  You lay out my comments in a soft, pleasing green. 
Oh Zenburn, promise me you shall see me through the better part of my
life. </p>

                    <p>On a very recent chai-coffee induced chat with <a href="http://artagnon.com">Ram</a>, I discovered
the origin of the word 'interest' as used by banks and other lending
entities. </p>
<p>Interest is the incentive you get for putting your money in a bank
account or for lending your money out. It is your interest in that
action. This may seem trivial but it seemed like a Eureka moment to
me. </p>

                    <p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> very rightly says, a programming language should be
malleable. It should allow you to quickly prototype a project and then
beat the code into shape. </p>
<p>Static typing, like in java, is prohibitive of this approach. Another 
feature I feel is unnecessarily bureaucratic : interfaces. Interfaces 
sound too good to be true. They smell a lot like modularity and it is
remarkable how if used correctly, they can lead to highly decoupled 
code. But interfaces also hide a lot of data. The actual implementation 
may contain substantial information that is inaccessible to outside 
code. </p>
<p>The more I program in Java, the more I feel it spends more time preventing 
me from doing things, than helping me out. In a way, you turn out to be 
your own "pointy-haired-boss". First, the PHB in you writes the interface. 
Then the employee in you starts writing an implementation based on the 
guidelines laid down by the PHB. Once this is done, you both are happy 
until there arises a requirement for some more features that this interface
doesn't support. You send a request to PHB, he writes more of the interface 
and the employee in you writes more code to implement the interface and this 
cycle continues.</p>
<p>I am writing a RIA in <a href="http://webtoolkit.googlecode.com/">GWT</a>. I am trying to adhere to the design patterns 
laid out in the documentation. Sometimes, in the spirit of the code, just
to make something work, I tend to step out of the design pattern and code
arbitrarily. Now, when I have to refactor the code to align it to the pattern,
I find myself terrified of the effort it would take to acheive that.</p>
<p>Having been on Java for about 3 months, when I try to write python
code, I find myself thinking in Java. I find the lack of types and interfaces
difficult to manage. I am writing up un-pythonic reflection based systems to
implement features similar to interfaces and type-checking in java. </p>
<p>Python, I shall see you soon, and when I do...</p>
