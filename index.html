                <span class="post-date">January, 2012</span>
                <div id="post-contents" class="post-contents">
                    <p>Most of our primary responses, as humans, can be attributed to
evolution.  We react peculiarly to stimuli because they enhance our
chances of survival: both as individuals and as a species.  We find
babies cute because it makes us protective of our young.  Similarly,
when we hear exceedingly loud explosions, we duck first and <strong>then</strong>
look back.</p>
<p>What, then, could be the reason we find beauty beautiful?  We know
beauty is a primeval response.  We don't have rational control over
it.  We find beauty in more than just other humans.   Repeating
patterns, complementary colours,  clean design, italicised serif
fonts, natural landforms and we could go on and on. </p>
<p>I will now lead you to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PktUzdnBqWI">this video</a> which explains, via a rather
entertaining animation sequence, the Darwinian concept of beauty.  One
of the features of the theory says that meticulous workmanship is
beautiful because it is an indicator of fine motor control which is a
preferable quality in the progression of a species.  Natural
landscapes which resemble the habitat that our predecessors evolved in
are often considered beautiful.  The presence of a path in any
photograph/painting makes it so much more aesthetically pleasing
because it indicates the presence of humans.</p>
<p>My interest, however, is in why and how we find some web-pages
particularly beautiful.  There are no evolutionary contemporaries of
web-pages I am sure, so why do we find some pages pleasing?</p>
<p>To be continued...<br />

                    <p>I am a vim user.  <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2156">Leo</a> was my choice of a colorscheme.  It offers
quite a palette of well-balanced colours.  Contrast is adequately 
high while on a laptop.</p>

<p>When I switched to a desktop, I spent substantial time trying to
figure out the perfect brightness/contrast ratio.  One that soothed
the eyes. </p>
<p>I don't recall how I came across you, <a href="http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/">zenburn</a>, but my eyes are
thankful that I did.  You make my background a lighter shade of
grey and use a subtle palette of pastel colours.  The lowered contrast
enables me to take code in for longer hours.  What would I do without
you!</p>

<p>What is most surprising about you, my dear, is that you make my 
comments look great.  The more comments I have, the prettier you
make my code look.  You lay out my comments in a soft, pleasing green. 
Oh Zenburn, promise me you shall see me through the better part of my
life. </p>

                    <p>On a very recent chai-coffee induced chat with <a href="http://artagnon.com">Ram</a>, I discovered
the origin of the word 'interest' as used by banks and other lending
entities. </p>
<p>Interest is the incentive you get for putting your money in a bank
account or for lending your money out. It is your interest in that
action. This may seem trivial but it seemed like a Eureka moment to
me. </p>
