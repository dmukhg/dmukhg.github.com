                    <p>On a very recent chai-coffee induced chat with <a href="http://artagnon.com">Ram</a>, I discovered
the origin of the word 'interest' as used by banks and other lending
entities. </p>
<p>Interest is the incentive you get for putting your money in a bank
account or for lending your money out. It is your interest in that
action. This may seem trivial but it seemed like a Eureka moment to
me. </p>

                    <p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> very rightly says, a programming language should be
malleable. It should allow you to quickly prototype a project and then
beat the code into shape. </p>
<p>Static typing, like in java, is prohibitive of this approach. Another 
feature I feel is unnecessarily bureaucratic : interfaces. Interfaces 
sound too good to be true. They smell a lot like modularity and it is
remarkable how if used correctly, they can lead to highly decoupled 
code. But interfaces also hide a lot of data. The actual implementation 
may contain substantial information that is inaccessible to outside 
code. </p>
<p>The more I program in Java, the more I feel it spends more time preventing 
me from doing things, than helping me out. In a way, you turn out to be 
your own "pointy-haired-boss". First, the PHB in you writes the interface. 
Then the employee in you starts writing an implementation based on the 
guidelines laid down by the PHB. Once this is done, you both are happy 
until there arises a requirement for some more features that this interface
doesn't support. You send a request to PHB, he writes more of the interface 
and the employee in you writes more code to implement the interface and this 
cycle continues.</p>
<p>I am writing a RIA in <a href="http://webtoolkit.googlecode.com/">GWT</a>. I am trying to adhere to the design patterns 
laid out in the documentation. Sometimes, in the spirit of the code, just
to make something work, I tend to step out of the design pattern and code
arbitrarily. Now, when I have to refactor the code to align it to the pattern,
I find myself terrified of the effort it would take to acheive that.</p>
<p>Having been on Java for about 3 months, when I try to write python
code, I find myself thinking in Java. I find the lack of types and interfaces
difficult to manage. I am writing up un-pythonic reflection based systems to
implement features similar to interfaces and type-checking in java. </p>
<p>Python, I shall see you soon, and when I do...</p>

                <span class="post-date">May, 2011</span>
                <div id="post-contents" class="post-contents">
                    <p>Disclosure: The source code and some other ideas are from one of 
<a href="http://kennethjorgensen.com/blog/2010/04/12/proxy-servlet-for-gwt-in-devmode/">Kenneth Jorgensen's blog post</a></p>
<p>As you start developing with the Google Web Toolkit, you may find yourself
stuck because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">"Same Origin Policy"</a> restrictions that browser
developers have implemented. </p>
<p>The SOP restricts scripts running on the browser from placing
XmlHTTPRequests to hosts other than the host from which the current page 
was requested. This is a short, possibly imprecise definition. What really
matters is that if you develop your server-side API in a language other than
Java, you will have trouble accessing that API while in devmode.</p>
<p>What you can do is, use a language-agnostic servlet that runs on the GWT 
development mode server and proxies your requests to another server.<br />
</p>
<p>I won't dump the entire java servlet file here. You can find a link
<a href="/media/resources/ProxyServlet.java">here</a>. There is a dirty hack in the servlet; I describe it later. </p>
<p>To make this work, you have to edit the web.xml file within the
WEB-INF directory within the war directory not the *.gwt.xml file.
As far as I understand, (I am a noob to GWT) the *.gwt.xml file is
to be updated with the details of a servlet when you use GWT-RPC.</p>
<p>Here is a snapshot of my web.xml.</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE web-app</span>
<span class="cp">    PUBLIC &quot;-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN&quot;</span>
<span class="cp">    &quot;http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd&quot;&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;web-app&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;servlet&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;servlet-name&gt;</span>proxy<span class="nt">&lt;/servlet-name&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;servlet-class&gt;</span>in.dmulog.gwt.ProxyServlet<span class="nt">&lt;/servlet-class&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/servlet&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;servlet-name&gt;</span>proxy<span class="nt">&lt;/servlet-name&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;url-pattern&gt;</span>/proxy/*<span class="nt">&lt;/url-pattern&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;</span>
    <span class="c">&lt;!-- Default page to serve --&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;welcome-file-list&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;welcome-file&gt;</span>Client.html<span class="nt">&lt;/welcome-file&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/welcome-file-list&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/web-app&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now, if you update the code according to your own setup, any
requests at <span class="inline_code">localhost:8888/proxy/this/uri</span> will be forwarded to
<span class="inline_code">localhost:8000/this/uri</span>. Or as the case may be. You can define all
this in the java servlet file. </p>
<p>Now about the dirty hack I talked about. Within the java file, line
number 68 reads:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">uri</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">append</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">req</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getRequestURI</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">substring</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="o">));</span>
</pre></div>
<p>What the substring part does is converts
<span class="inline_code">localhost:8888/proxy/foo/bar/baz</span> to a request to
<span class="inline_code">localhost:8000/foo/bar/baz</span>. </p>
<p>If we don't use the substring hack, it remains as a request to
<span class="inline_code">localhost:8000/<strong>proxy</strong>/foo/bar/baz</span> which might not be useful in
your case. You can possibly do this better with splitting the string
and joining. But hey, I said it was dirty. </p>
<p>Happy coding.</p>
