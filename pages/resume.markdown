## Summary 
I am a self-taught programmer.  I have strong background in
engineering software from the ground up, with a keen eye towards
**usability**.<br>

## Work Experience
**G-Node, INCF at LMU, Munich | Developer** <span class="post-date">December 2011 - January 2012</span>

Wrote a javascript profiling tool and tests using it to benchmark
web-plotting libraries.  Wrote a Javascript [library][8] using the SVG
API and [d3][9] for plotting of multiple time-series in a dynamic and
event driven architecture.

<br>
**International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility | Student Developer** <span class="post-date">Summer 2011</span>

Worked with the [German Node][7] of INCF, as a **Google Summer of Code**
Student developer, on building a [**Data Analysis Tool**][6] specifically
tailored to handle **multi-channel time series** data. 

The application was developed using the [Google Web Toolkit][2].

<br>
**Dataresolve Technologies, Kolkata | Development Intern** <span class="post-date">Winter 2010</span>

Researched and implemented a prototype, from the ground-up, of a
**document security layer** over Google Docs.  Development was done in
python/django using Google Data APIs.

Being a startup environment, this internship improved my 
**technical communication** skills, also adding to my experience with 
**product-design and conceptualization**.

<br>
**Entrepreneurship Cell, IIT Kharagpur | Web Team Head** <span class="post-date">Since Summer 2010</span>

Developed a **CMS-like solution** from the ground up using a django/mysql
setup\*.  During this time, I was also responsible for server upkeep and
tackled various **DNS and System Administration tasks**.

<span style="font-size: 0.8em">* This solution was replaced in 2011 by a
static website for lack of python developers</span>

<br>
**IndiaKhelo.com, Bangalore, Software Engineering Intern** <span class="post-date">Summer 2010</span>

Developed a **visual-report generating** application using [ReportLab][3].
The application had a plugin-oriented data-entry interface. 

<br>
##Proficiencies
Javascript (non-trivial), Python, Java, C (in decreasing order of
experience).  I have a strong grasp of the web-development
lifecycle.  I have experience with both backend and frontend
development.  Usability and simplicity are key stress points in my
approach.

<br>
## Education
Currently enrolled in a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of
Technology, Kharagpur

Expected Graduation : 2013
