                    <p>It is not very hard to describe yourself, especially if you have very
few things to say. I am Dipanjan. I am a self-taught programmer. I love
what I do. I am a geek, not a nerd. I spend most of my time in front of
computer screen(s). When I am not, I like talking to people. The human
experience and interfacing is as integral to me as programming. </p>
<p>I love abstractions. Python is what I use currently. I am slowly growing
towards functional languages. Let's see how that works out.</p>
<h2>About this site</h2>
<p>This blog-cum-journal is intended to be a pensieve of sorts. Sorry for 
the HP allegory. I find, when I look at code that I have written a year
back, I find stark differences both in my coding style and my thought
processes. It is quite a revelation to observe yourself change. 
I started writing this blog so that I could look back some years from now
and watch myself grow. Hopefully :). </p>
<p>This site is generated by <a href="http://github.com/schatten/sorry">sorry</a>. It is a static-html generator that 
is powered by <a href="http://www.makotemplates.org/">mako</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">markdown</a>. It works for me, you could give
it a shot too. If you like the results.</p>
