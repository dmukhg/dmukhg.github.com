            <p>I had to select a few developers to work with me at developing the <a href="http://www.ecell-iitkgp.org">ecell website</a> further. 
There are many loose ends to tie up. However, working out a selection procedure was in itself
a mammoth task. I had to try to keep the technicalities to a minimum, focus on logic and interest, 
both of which are difficult to cardinalize. I came up with a solution, with help from Sid who selected
me in my first year. Test them on fundamentals which are not bound to any language/framework in particular.
Logical tests and some database concepts. The common element in all these would-be questions was that they
had left me amazed when I discovered the answers. </p>
<p>Here is the paper.</p>

<h2>Discussion:</h2>
<p>Question 1:</p>
<p>Concentrating on the relationship between the books and authors is the key point in this question.
In one particular solution, there are 3 tables. One representing the authors. another for the books
and a third one for the relationship. This table is often called a linker table.</p>
<img src="/media/im/web-selections-db.png">

<p>As is clearly visible, the linker table takes the pk (primary key:a unique identifier) of a book and 
a pk of the author and connects the two in a manner which limits the number of columns : A key requirement
in a database schema.</p>
<p>Question 2:</p>
<p>The flaw in this code snippet is that the /astra url will never be reached. This is because the line
immediately above it captures all urls which begin with /a (including /astra) and the control never reaches 
the /astra line. One way to circumvent this is to swap the two lines. This way, the condition is avoided.</p>
<p>Question 3:</p>
<p>We could use javascript to preload the images. This is the easy way out and works most of the time. I agree this
involves prior knowledge of this feature. But infact, there is another way which shouldn't prior knowledge : Sprites.
Assume you have the case as mentioned in the question. A rollover button. You have one image. When you move the mouse
over the image, it changes. Assume the images are both 40x20 in size. Now you can compose an image of 40x40 size 
containing both the images in two halves. Then using the CSS property of background-position, you can easily shift the image
at the required event. This is a sure-shot method since there is only one image and will have been downloaded completely
if it is being displayed at all.</p>
<p>Question 4:</p>
<p>This question was indeed a tough one. <a href="http://www.yeban.in">Anurag</a> came up with it. The question has many answers. Maybe I will ask him 
to come up with his own some day. For now, you are stuck with my version of it. So here goes.</p>
<p>One way is to fetch different kinds of data from different fine-tuned servers (think Content Delivery Networks). For
example, images could be fetched from a server running Nginx which is actually the fastest static content server
I have seen. Also, some form of load-balancing cluster could be used to distribute the load across multiple servers.
This answers both the cases of scalability and optimisation.</p>
<p>Another method could be to use redundant data-servers across diverse geographical locations.</p>
<p>Query optimisation often works but is a very very tedious task. Repeat.. Very Tedious.</p>
