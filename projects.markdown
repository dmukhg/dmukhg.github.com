### Sane Start Page <small style="float: right;">[Project Page][ssp]</small>

A chrome extension that replaces the default new tab page with a view of your
bookmarks + apps. It allows you to pin a particular folder in your bookmarks,
say 'Read Later'.

<div class="imgcon">
  <img src="images/sane-screen1.png">
  <span class="caption">Sane-Start-Page in action</span>
</div>

So you can build up a working mode like such: You are browsing, you find an
article that you want to read but can't at the moment, you use the 'star' icon
in the chrome location bar to bookmark this page to your 'Read Later' or
equivalent folder. Now when you open your browser the next time,
Sane-Start-Page shows you all such bookmarks by default.

These are some of the projects I thought are good enough to talk about. A more
exhaustive list can be found on my [github][github].
