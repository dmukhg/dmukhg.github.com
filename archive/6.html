                    <p>I use vim.  Until recently, I was using a laptop and had a colorscheme
called <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2156">leo</a> on it.  Leo offers quite a palette of colours and
moderately high contrast.</p>
<p>Switching to a desktop, I had to tweak about with the
brightness/contrast settings on the monitors, trying to find the most
soothing combinations.  Reading code was painful on the eyes.  I was
still using leo.<br />
</p>
<p>I don't recall how I came across <a href="http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/">zenburn</a>.  The effect was pronounced.
Zenburn makes your background lighter and uses a more subtle pastel palette. 
The lower contrast is great for long hours of coding in darker rooms.</p>
<p>What is most surprising about zenburn, however, is that it makes
comments look great.  The more comments you have, the prettier your
code looks.  Comments come in a soft green.  Very pleasing. </p>
<p>Code I wrote henceforth had substantially more comments.</p>
