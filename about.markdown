## About the author

Writing an introduction to an introduction of yourself is a pretty hefty task.  I will set that aside and dig right in.

I am a programmer.  I primarily work on client-side development using javascript and HTML/CSS etc.  I also love to use [django][django] and [python][python] on a variety of projects that keep me busy.  Of late, I have also begun working on [Spiking Neural Networks][snn] and am writing a [simulator][moment] based on CUDA.

On a side note, I am becoming increasingly interested in Typography for the web.

If you want to employ me or work with me, here is a link to my [resume][resume] and my [email][email].

This site is spit by [jekyll][jekyll] from a template that I designed to work on small as well as big screens using CSS only. For more details on the design principles for this website, you can refer to [this][crazytown] blog post on the topic.
