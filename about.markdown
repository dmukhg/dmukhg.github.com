## About me

I am a programmer and a student.  I primarily work on client-side development
using Javascript and HTML/css etc.  I also work with the [django][django]
web-framework and the [python][python] programming language on a variety of
projects that keep me busy.  

Typography for the web has caught my attention recently and I am exploring
various practical aspects of it.

At college, I have been working on [Spiking Neural Networks][snn] and am
writing a [simulator][moment] based on the NVIDIA CUDA platform.

I love lonely walks and one-on-one heavy-duty discussions.

In case you are seeking to employ me or work with me, here is a link to my
[resume][resume].  If you want to contact me, maybe have a discussion (or an
argument), here is my [email][email].
