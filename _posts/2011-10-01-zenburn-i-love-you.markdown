title: Zenburn, I love you..
snip: Zenburn is a colorscheme available on vim and other editors.  This post describes why I find it one of the best ones around and how it makes me a better programmer.

I am a vim user.  [Leo][1] was my choice of a colorscheme.  It offers quite a palette of well-balanced colours.  Contrast is adequately high while on a laptop.  Also, it is easy to make out the colours from one another.  Within mere days of using it, the semantic information conveyed by the colours made sense without any conscious thought.

When I switched to a desktop, I spent substantial time trying to figure out the perfect brightness/contrast ratio.  I had quite some trouble with deciding on such a ratio.  Some were great for short bursts of viewing but as soon as I started using it for more than an hour, my eyes started paining. 

I don't recall how I came across you, [zenburn][2], but my eyes are thankful that I did.  You make my background a lighter shade of grey and use a subtle palette of pastel colours.  The lowered contrast enables me to take code in for longer hours, even in the dark.  The dark is when I am most intimate with you Zenburn, most comfortable.  What would I do without you!

What is most surprising about you, my dear, is that you make my comments look great.  The more comments I have, the prettier you make my code look.  You lay out my comments in a soft, pleasing green.  It feels great when my comments are laid out in such soothing colours.  I add more comments, which makes my code look greener and is easier for me to understand.  Oh Zenburn, promise me you shall see me through the better part of my life.
