title: On Citizenship and Law
snip: An exploration of citizenship as a contract and the inherenet obligation on the part of citizenry to abide by the rules, laws and duties prescribed by the state
---

First, let's examine citizenship in the context of a modern democracy.  When
one accepts to become a citizen of a state, the underlying *contract* is that
one will abide by the laws of the state, will obey directives instituted by the
state and participate in the society like other citizens.  This contract isn't
totalitarian.  After becoming a citizen, if a piece of legislation or a
directive doesn't comply with the well-being of the state's people, citizen's
have every right to protest its existence or ask for it to be changed.

This brings us to another important question: What, if any, is the purpose of a
state?  Why not live in simple distributed societies with their own code of
law?  Large institutions, such as the modern-state, or even kingdoms exist
because they align well with human purpose.  They allow us to focus on what we
want to pursue and not be bogged down with administrative and judicial duties.
