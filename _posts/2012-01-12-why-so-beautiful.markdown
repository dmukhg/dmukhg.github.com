title: Why so beautiful? 
snip: A theoretical exploration of evolutionary and psychological reasons justifying why some web-pages look to good to be true and others are simply hard to look at.

Most of our primary responses, as humans, can be attributed to evolution.  We react peculiarly to stimuli because they enhance our chances of survival: both as individuals and as a species.  We find babies cute because it makes us protective of our young.  Similarly, when we hear exceedingly loud explosions, we duck first and **then** look back.

What, then, could be the reason we find beauty beautiful?  We know beauty is a primeval response.  We don't have rational control over it.  We find beauty in more than just other humans.   Repeating patterns, complementary colours,  clean design, italicised serif fonts, natural landforms and we could go on and on. 

I will now lead you to [this video][1] which explains, via a rather entertaining animation sequence, the Darwinian concept of beauty.  One of the features of the theory says that meticulous workmanship is beautiful because it is an indicator of fine motor control which is a preferable quality in the progression of a species.  Natural landscapes which resemble the habitat that our predecessors evolved in are often considered beautiful.  The presence of a path in any photograph/painting makes it so much more aesthetically pleasing because it indicates the presence of humans.

My interest, however, is in why and how we find some web-pages particularly beautiful.  There are no evolutionary contemporaries of web-pages I am sure, so why do we find some pages pleasing?
