###{{ page.title }}

I am a vim user.  [Leo][1] was my choice of a colorscheme.  It offers quite a palette of well-balanced colours.  Contrast is adequately high while on a laptop.

When I switched to a desktop, I spent substantial time trying to figure out the perfect brightness/contrast ratio.  One that soothed the eyes. 

I don't recall how I came across you, [zenburn][2], but my eyes are thankful that I did.  You make my background a lighter shade of grey and use a subtle palette of pastel colours.  The lowered contrast enables me to take code in for longer hours.  What would I do without you!

What is most surprising about you, my dear, is that you make my comments look great.  The more comments I have, the prettier you make my code look.  You lay out my comments in a soft, pleasing green.  Oh Zenburn, promise me you shall see me through the better part of my life.
