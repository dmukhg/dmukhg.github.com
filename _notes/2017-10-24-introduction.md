Writing large cogent arguments or expositions is hard. I have realised that I
usually have little to say. There is an enormity in brevity. Notes are
intentionally small pieces of writing that do not demand an essay. With notes, I
hope I will be able to write more frequently and be able to arrange my thoughts
better. Who knows, some of these notes may eventually become full fledged
essays.

Cheers!
