## Summary 

I am a self-taught programmer.  I have strong background in engineering software from the ground up, with a keen eye towards **usability**.

## Work Experience

**G-Node, INCF at LMU, Munich | Developer** | December 2011 - present 

Wrote a javascript profiling tool and tests using it to benchmark web-plotting libraries.  Wrote a Javascript [library][8] using the SVG API and [d3][9] for plotting of multiple time-series in a dynamic and event driven architecture.  Working on a rich-internet-application that manages and displays electrophysiological experimental data and metadata.

**International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility | Student Developer** Summer 2011

Worked with the [German Node][7] of INCF, as a **Google Summer of Code** Student developer, on building a [**Data Analysis Tool**][6] specifically tailored to handle **multi-channel time series** data. 

The application was developed using the [Google Web Toolkit][2].

**Dataresolve Technologies, Kolkata | Development Intern** Winter 2010

Researched and implemented a prototype, from the ground-up, of a **document security layer** over Google Docs.  Development was done in python/django using Google Data APIs.

Being a startup environment, this internship improved my **technical communication** skills, also adding to my experience with **product-design and conceptualization**.  

**Entrepreneurship Cell, IIT Kharagpur | Web Team Head** Since Summer 2010

Developed a **CMS-like solution** from the ground up using a django/mysql setup\*.  During this time, I was also responsible for server upkeep and
tackled various **DNS and System Administration tasks**.  

\* This solution was replaced in 2011 by a static website for lack of python developers

**IndiaKhelo.com, Bangalore, Software Engineering Intern** Summer 2010

Developed a **visual-report generating** application using [ReportLab][3].  The application had a plugin-oriented data-entry interface. 

## Proficiencies
Javascript (non-trivial), Python, Java, C (in decreasing order of experience).  I have a strong grasp of the web-development lifecycle.  I have experience with both backend and frontend development.  Usability and simplicity are key stress points in my approach.

## Education
Currently enrolled in a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur

Expected Graduation : 2013
