## Summary 

I am a self-taught programmer. I have experience working on web-based applications, especially web-frontends for rich internet applications. I would like to work as a part of a small team on a web-based, user-centric product.

## Work Experience

###G-Node, INCF at LMU, Munich | Developer
December 2011 - November 2012

Wrote a javascript profiling tool and tests using it to benchmark web-plotting libraries.  Wrote a Javascript [library][8] using the SVG API and [d3][9] for plotting of multiple time-series in a dynamic and event driven architecture.  Working on a rich-internet-application that manages and displays electrophysiological experimental data and metadata.

###Soft Computing Lab, IIT Kharagpur
August 2012 - present

I am working on a [Spiking Neural Network][snn] [implementation][moment] that runs on the Nvidia CUDA platform.

###International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility | Student Developer
Summer 2011

Worked with the [German Node][7] of INCF, as a **Google Summer of Code** Student developer, on building a [Data Analysis Tool][6] specifically tailored to handle multi-channel time series data. 

The application was developed using the [Google Web Toolkit][2].

###Dataresolve Technologies, Kolkata | Development Intern
Winter 2010

Researched and implemented a prototype, from the ground-up, of a document security layer over Google Docs.  Development was done in python/django using Google Data APIs.

Being a startup environment, this internship improved my technical communication skills, also adding to my experience with product-design and conceptualization.  

## Proficiencies
Javascript, Python, Java, CUDA-C, C (in decreasing order of experience).  I also have a strong grasp of the web-development lifecycle and version control.

I find myself increasingly interested in the application of Typography to web-pages and also in responsive-design.

## Education
Currently enrolled in a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur
CGPA at the end of seven semesters: 7.52

Expected Graduation : 2013
